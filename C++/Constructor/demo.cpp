// Constructor is a member function of a class, whose name is same as the class name.
// Constructor is a special type of member function that is used to initialize the data members for an object of a class automatically, when an object of the same class is created.
// Constructor do not return value, hence they do not have a return type.
// Constructor can be defined inside the class declaration or outside
// Constructors are mostly declared in the public section of the class though it can be declared in the private section of the class.
// Constructors can be overloaded.
// Constructor can not be declared virtual.
// Default Constructors donâ€™t have input argument however, Copy and Parameterized Constructors have input arguments
// Constructor cannot be inherited.
// Addresses of Constructor cannot be referred.
// have more than one constructor in a class (constructor overloading)
// Default constructor
// Parameterized constructor
// Overloaded constructor
// Constructor with default value
// Copy constructor
// Inline constructor

// A destructor is also a special member function like a constructor. Destructor destroys the class objects created by the constructor.
// Destructor has the same name as their class name preceded by a tilde (~) symbol.
// It is not possible to define more than one destructor.
// The destructor is only one way to destroy the object created by the constructor.
// destructor can-not be overloaded.
// Destructor neither requires any argument nor returns any value.
// It is automatically called when an object goes out of scope.
// Destructor release memory space occupied by the objects created by the constructor.
// In destructor, objects are destroyed in the reverse of an object creation.
// It cannot be declared static or const.
// An object of a class with a Destructor cannot become a member of the union.
// The programmer cannot access the address of the destructor.
